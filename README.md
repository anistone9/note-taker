Application Using Express.js Back-End to Write and Save Notes

## Description   
This application allows users to write and save notes, helping them organize their tasks and keep track of them. It uses Express.js, and it saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file. The landing page displays a link to a notes page, which contains previously created notes on the left side of the screen, and buttons to create and save new notes on the right side of the screen. Once a new note is created and saved, it gets displayed in the left section.
